# SpreeBs4

This extension adds Bootstrap 4 CSS and Javascript into the frontend of your Spree project. The spree_bs4 extension is intended to be used after the spree_remove_bs3 gem has been installed removing the Bootstrap 3 CSS and JS, instructions for use are below.

Please be aware that you will need to pick through your Spree frontend view files replacing the old Bootstrap 3 classes with the relevant Boostrap 4 classes, the extension assumes you will be doing some web design to entirely customise the look and feel of the Spree store, and therefor makes no attempt to render a pretty view out of the box.

If you find any issues while using this extension please raise an issue, or fork the project, fix/update/improve and then submit a pull request.
